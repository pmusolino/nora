## Downlaod the project and compile it on your machine
All you need is an Access Token from Instagram. I think it was this answer that I used to get it:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16496511/how-to-get-an-instagram-access-token

And then you'll need to create a struct with a static property inside the project:
```swift
struct InstagramSecret {
  static let accessToken: "your-access-token-here"
}
```

Then you should be able to compile and use it ✌🏻😊

## One more thing
You can do whatever you want with this project <b> as long </b> as the outcome is for free. <br />
Meaning no commercial use. I want to provide value for free and try to maintain it 😉
